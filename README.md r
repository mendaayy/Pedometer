# Pedometer

## Introduction
During my specialisation in Smart Mobile, I had to learn about kotlin and create my first ever android app.
I decided to create a pedometer app; an app that uses the android built-in motion sensors to count your total steps. The app can listen to 2 types of sensors:
the accelerometer and the step-counter. Additionally, it also saves the steps taken in the morning from 6 till 12 and the steps taken since the last reboot
of the device. In the end, you can reset the step count or it can reset automatically when it reaches the step count goal.

## Tools & Technologies
- Kotlin
- XML
- Android studio

## Process
It was my first time creating an Android app, so I had to learn the basics first through tutorials. I also chose to use XML instead of Jetpack compose, because you can find more recourses about it online. When I was coding the project, I spent a lot of time retrieving the data from the sensor. I did not know that different android phones have different motion sensors for the step count. I was using the sensor type of accelerometer while my android phone has the step-counter as the sensor type. I thought it wasn't working due to bugs, but it was simply just not using the right sensor. So, now my code works, for both sensor types. In the end, I did a simple UI with e progess circularbar library.
