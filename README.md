# Pedometer

## Introduction
During my specialisation in Smart Mobile, I had to learn about kotlin and create my first ever android app.
I decided to create a pedometer app; an app that uses the android built-in motion sensors to count your total steps. The app can listen to 2 types of sensors:
the accelerometer and the step-counter. Additionally, it also saves the steps taken in the morning from 6 till 12 and the steps taken since the last reboot
of the device. In the end, you can reset the step count or it can reset automatically when it reaches the step count goal.

## Tools & Technologies
- Kotlin
- XML
- Android studio

## Process
It was my first time creating an Android app, so I had to learn the basics first through
